# Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm

The Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm is a Python class that implements hierarchical clustering for data clustering tasks. It allows users to cluster data points into a predefined number of clusters based on their similarity.

## Usage:

1. Initialize the HierarchicalClustering object with the desired number of clusters and linkage method.
2. Fit the model to the data using the `fit` method.
3. Predict cluster labels for new data points using the `predict` method.

## Features:

- Supports different linkage methods including single, complete, and average linkage.
- Customizable number of clusters for clustering tasks.
- Efficient implementation of the hierarchical clustering algorithm.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
